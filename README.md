## 🎙️ AgentVibes MCP

Agent Vibes was originally created to give the Claude Code assistant a voice! Simply install it with an npx command in your terminal, and Claude Code can talk back to you.

We've now enhanced this capability by adding an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. This integration exposes Agent Vibes' functionality directly to your AI assistant, allowing you to configure and control Agent Vibes using natural language instead of typing "/" slash commands.

Setting it up is straightforward: just add the MCP server to your Claude Code configuration files.

But the convenience doesn't stop there. With the MCP server in place, Claude Desktop can now use Agent Vibes too! We've even tested it successfully with Warp, an AI assistant that helps you navigate Windows and other operating systems.

We're thrilled about this expansion because it means Claude Desktop and Warp can finally talk back as well!

If you decide to use the MCP server on Claude Desktop, after configuration, give Claude Desktop this command: "every time i give you a command, speak the acknowledgement using agentvibes and the confirmation about what you completed, when done"—and watch the magic happen!

**🎯 Control AgentVibes with natural language - no slash commands to remember!**

Just say "Switch to Aria voice" or "Speak in Spanish" instead of typing commands.

**Works in:** Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Warp Terminal

**[→ View Complete MCP Setup Guide](docs/mcp-setup.md)** - Full setup for all platforms, configuration examples, available tools, and MCP vs slash commands comparison

## 📋 System Requirements

AgentVibes requires certain system dependencies for optimal audio processing and playback. Requirements vary by operating system and TTS provider.

### Core Requirements (All Platforms)

| Tool | Required For | Why It's Needed |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Node.js** ≥16.0 | All platforms | Runtime for AgentVibes installer and MCP server |
| **Bash** ≥5.0 | macOS | Modern bash features (macOS ships with 3.2 from 2007) |
| **Python** 3.10+ | Piper TTS, MCP server | Runs Piper voice engine and MCP server |

### Audio Processing Tools (Recommended)

| Tool | Status | Purpose | Impact if Missing |
|------|--------|---------|------------------|
| **sox** | Recommended | Audio effects (reverb, EQ, pitch, compression) | No audio effects, still works |
| **ffmpeg** | Recommended | Background music mixing, audio padding, RDP compression | No background music or RDP optimization |

### Platform-Specific Requirements

#### 🐧 Linux / WSL

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y sox ffmpeg python3-pip pipx

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install -y sox ffmpeg python3-pip pipx

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S sox ffmpeg python-pip python-pipx
```

**Audio Playback** (one of the following):
- `paplay` (PulseAudio - usually pre-installed)
- `aplay` (ALSA - fallback)
- `mpg123` (fallback)
- `mpv` (fallback)

**Why these tools?**
- **sox**: Applies audio effects defined in `.claude/config/audio-effects.cfg` (reverb, pitch shifting, EQ, compression)
- **ffmpeg**: Mixes background music tracks, adds silence padding to prevent audio cutoff, compresses audio for RDP/SSH sessions
- **paplay/aplay**: Plays generated TTS audio files
- **pipx**: Isolated Python environment manager for Piper TTS installation

#### 🍎 macOS

```bash
# Install Homebrew if not already installed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Required: Modern bash
brew install bash

# Recommended: Audio processing tools
brew install sox ffmpeg pipx
```

**Audio Playback**:
- `afplay` (built-in - always available)
- `say` (built-in - for macOS TTS provider)

**Why these tools?**
- **bash 5.x**: macOS ships with bash 3.2 which lacks associative arrays and other modern features AgentVibes uses
- **sox**: Same audio effects processing as Linux
- **ffmpeg**: Same background music and padding as Linux
- **afplay**: Built-in macOS audio player
- **say**: Built-in macOS text-to-speech (alternative to Piper)

#### 🪟 Windows

**Option A: Native Windows (Recommended)**

AgentVibes now supports native Windows with three TTS providers. No WSL required!

```powershell
# Interactive Node.js installer (recommended)
npx agentvibes install

# Or use the standalone PowerShell installer
.\setup-windows.ps1
```

**Providers available natively:**
- **Soprano** - Ultra-fast neural TTS (best quality, requires `pip install soprano-tts`)
- **Windows Piper** - High quality offline neural voices (auto-downloaded)
- **Windows SAPI** - Built-in Windows voices (zero setup)

**Requirements:** Node.js 16+, PowerShell 5.1+, ffmpeg (optional, for background music & reverb)

See [Windows Native Setup Guide](WINDOWS-SETUP.md) for full instructions.

**Option B: WSL (Legacy)**

For Claude Desktop or WSL-based workflows, follow the [Windows WSL Guide](mcp-server/WINDOWS_SETUP.md).

```powershell
# Install WSL from PowerShell (Administrator)
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

Then follow Linux requirements above inside WSL.

#### 🤖 Android / Termux

**Running Claude Code on Your Android Using Termux**

AgentVibes fully supports Android devices through the [Termux app](https://termux.dev/). This enables you to run Claude Code with professional TTS voices directly on your Android phone or tablet!

**Quick Setup:**

```bash
# 1. Install Termux from F-Droid (NOT Google Play - it's outdated)
# Download: https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/

# 2. Install Node.js in Termux
pkg update && pkg upgrade
pkg install nodejs-lts

# 3. Install AgentVibes (auto-detects Android and runs Termux installer)
npx agentvibes install
```

**What Gets Installed?**

The Termux installer automatically sets up:
- **proot-distro** with Debian (for glibc compatibility)
- **Piper TTS** via proot wrapper (Android uses bionic libc, not glibc)
- **termux-media-player** for audio playback (`paplay` doesn't work on Android)
- **Audio dependencies**: ffmpeg, sox, bc for processing
- **termux-api** for Android-specific audio routing

**Why Termux Instead of Standard Installation?**

Android's architecture requires special handling:
- ❌ Standard pip/pipx fails (missing wheels for bionic libc)
- ❌ Linux binaries require glibc (Android uses bionic)
- ❌ `/tmp` directory is not accessible on Android
- ❌ Standard audio tools like `paplay` don't exist

✅ Termux installer solves all these issues with proot-distro and Android-native audio playback!

**Requirements:**
- [Termux app](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) (from F-Droid, NOT Google Play)
- [Termux:API](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux.api/) (for audio playback)
- Android 7.0+ (recommended: Android 10+)
- ~500MB free storage (for Piper TTS + voice models)

**Audio Playback:**
- Uses `termux-media-player` instead of `paplay`
- Audio automatically routes through Android's media system
- Supports all Piper TTS voices (50+ languages)

**Verifying Your Setup:**

```bash
# Check Termux environment
echo $PREFIX               # Should show /data/data/com.termux/files/usr

# Check Node.js
node --version             # Should be ≥16.0

# Check if Piper is installed
which piper                # Should return /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/piper

# Test audio playback
termux-media-player play /path/to/audio.wav
```

**Troubleshooting:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "piper: not found" | Run `npx agentvibes install` - auto-detects Termux |
| No audio playback | Install Termux:API from F-Droid |
| Permission denied | Run `termux-setup-storage` to grant storage access |
| Slow installation | Use WiFi, not mobile data (~300MB download) |

**Why F-Droid and Not Google Play?**

Google Play's Termux version is outdated and unsupported. Always use the [F-Droid version](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) for the latest security updates and compatibility.

### TTS Provider Requirements

#### Piper TTS (Free, Offline)
- **Python** 3.10+
- **pipx** (for isolated installation)
- **Disk Space**: ~50MB per voice model
- **Internet**: Only for initial voice downloads

```bash
# Installed automatically by AgentVibes
pipx install piper-tts
```

#### macOS Say (Built-in, macOS Only)
- No additional requirements
- 100+ voices pre-installed on macOS
- Use: `/agent-vibes:provider switch macos`

### Verifying Your Setup

```bash
# Check all dependencies
node --version    # Should be ≥16.0
python3 --version # Should be ≥3.10
bash --version    # Should be ≥5.0 (macOS users!)
sox --version     # Optional but recommended
ffmpeg -version   # Optional but recommended
pipx --version    # Required for Piper TTS

# Check audio playback (Linux/WSL)
paplay --version || aplay --version

# Check audio playback (macOS)
which afplay      # Should return /usr/bin/afplay
```

### What Happens Without Optional Dependencies?

| Missing Tool | Impact | Workaround |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| sox | No audio effects (reverb, EQ, pitch) | TTS still works, just no effects |
| ffmpeg | No background music, no audio padding | TTS still works, audio may cut off slightly early |
| paplay/aplay | No audio playback on Linux | Install at least one audio player |

**All TTS generation still works** - optional tools only enhance the experience!

# Personality & sentiment
/agent-vibes:personality pirate       # Or: "Set personality to pirate"
/agent-vibes:sentiment sarcastic      # Or: "Apply sarcastic sentiment"

# Language & learning
/agent-vibes:set-language spanish     # Or: "Speak in Spanish"
/agent-vibes:learn                    # Or: "Enable learning mode"
```

## 🎙️ Verbosity Control

**Control how much Claude speaks while working!** 🔊

Choose from three verbosity levels:

### LOW (Minimal) 🔇
- Acknowledgments only (start of task)
- Completions only (end of task)
- Perfect for quiet work sessions

### MEDIUM (Balanced) 🤔
- Acknowledgments + completions
- Major decisions ("I'll use grep to search")
- Key findings ("Found 12 instances")
- Perfect for understanding decisions without full narration

### HIGH (Maximum Transparency) 💭
- All reasoning ("Let me search for all instances")
- All decisions ("I'll use grep for this")
- All findings ("Found it at line 1323")
- Perfect for learning mode, debugging complex tasks

**Quick Commands:**
```bash
/agent-vibes:verbosity           # Show current level
/agent-vibes:verbosity high      # Maximum transparency
/agent-vibes:verbosity medium    # Balanced
/agent-vibes:verbosity low       # Minimal (default)
```

**MCP Equivalent:**
```
"Set verbosity to high"
"What's my current verbosity level?"
```

💡 **How it works:** Claude uses emoji markers (💭 🤔 ✓) in its text, and AgentVibes automatically detects and speaks them based on your verbosity level. No manual TTS calls needed!

⚠️ **Note:** Changes take effect on next Claude Code session restart.

## 📚 Language Learning Mode

**🎯 Learn Spanish (or 30+ languages) while you program!** 🌍

Every task acknowledgment plays **twice** - first in English, then in your target language. Context-based learning while you code!

## 🎭 Personalities vs Sentiments

**Two ways to add personality:**

- **🎪 Personalities** - Changes BOTH voice AND speaking style (e.g., `pirate` personality = Pirate Marshal voice + pirate speak)
- **💭 Sentiments** - Keeps your current voice, only changes speaking style (e.g., Aria voice + sarcastic sentiment)

**[→ Complete Personalities Guide](docs/personalities.md)** - All 19 personalities, create custom ones

## 🗣️ Voice Library

AgentVibes includes professional AI voices from Piper TTS and macOS Say with multilingual support.

🎧 **Try in Claude Code:** `/agent-vibes:preview` to hear all voices
🌍 **Multilingual:** Use Antoni, Rachel, Domi, or Bella for automatic language detection

**[→ View Complete Voice Library](docs/voice-library.md)** - All 27 voices with clickable samples, descriptions, and best use cases

---

## 🔌 BMAD Plugin

**Automatically switch voices when using BMAD agents!**

The BMAD plugin detects when you activate a BMAD agent (e.g., `/BMad:agents:pm`) and automatically uses the assigned voice for that role.

**Version Support**: AgentVibes supports both BMAD v4 and v6-alpha installations. Version detection is automatic - just install BMAD and AgentVibes will detect and configure itself correctly!

### 🔊 TTS Injection: How It Works

BMAD uses a **loosely-coupled injection system** for voice integration. BMAD source files contain placeholder markers that AgentVibes replaces with speaking instructions during installation:

**Before Installation (BMAD Source):**
```xml
<rules>
  <r>ALWAYS communicate in {communication_language}...</r>
  <!-- TTS_INJECTION:agent-tts -->
  <r>Stay in character until exit selected</r>
</rules>
```

**After Installation (with AgentVibes enabled):**
```xml
<rules>
  <r>ALWAYS communicate in {communication_language}...</r>
  - When responding to user messages, speak your responses using TTS:
      Call: `.claude/hooks/bmad-speak.sh '{agent-id}' '{response-text}'`
      Where {agent-id} is your agent type (pm, architect, dev, etc.)

  - Auto Voice Switching: AgentVibes automatically switches to the voice
      assigned for your agent role when activated
  <r>Stay in character until exit selected</r>
</rules>
```

**After Installation (with TTS disabled):**

#### Component 2: AgentVibes Receiver (Local/Phone) ⚠️ REQUIRED

**CRITICAL: You MUST install AgentVibes on your phone (or local machine) to receive and play audio!**

Without this, audio cannot be heard - the server generates TTS but needs a receiver to play it.

**Install on Android Phone (Termux):**

1. **Install Termux from F-Droid** (NOT Google Play):
   - Download: https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/

2. **Install Node.js in Termux:**
   ```bash
   pkg update && pkg upgrade
   pkg install nodejs-lts
   ```

3. **Install AgentVibes in Termux:**
   ```bash
   npx agentvibes install
   ```

4. **Install Termux:API** (for audio playback):
   - Download: https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux.api/
   - Then in Termux: `pkg install termux-api`

**Install on Local Mac/Linux:**

```bash
npx agentvibes install
```

**Why is this needed?**
- The **server generates TTS** but has no speakers (headless)
- AgentVibes on your **phone acts as the audio receiver** via SSH tunnel
- Audio tunnels from server → SSH → phone → speakers 🔊

Without AgentVibes installed on the receiving device, you'll generate audio but hear nothing!

#### How It Works: Server → SSH Tunnel → Local Playback

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│     🔊 "The weather is sunny and 72 degrees"            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Architecture:**
- **Server (OpenClaw)**: Generates TTS, sends via PulseAudio
- **SSH Tunnel**: RemoteForward port 14713 (encrypted transport)
- **Local (Termux/Desktop)**: AgentVibes receives audio, plays on speakers

This creates a **Siri-like experience** - message from anywhere, hear responses on your phone! 📱🎤

### 📝 Usage

#### Basic TTS Commands

```bash
# Basic TTS
npx agentvibes speak "Hello from OpenClaw"

# With different voices
npx agentvibes speak "Hello" --voice en_US-amy-medium
npx agentvibes speak "Bonjour" --voice fr_FR-siwis-medium

# List available voices
npx agentvibes voices
```

#### Advanced: Direct Hook Usage with Voice Override

For programmatic control, use the TTS hook directly:

```bash
# Basic: Use default voice
bash ~/.claude/hooks/play-tts.sh "Hello from OpenClaw"

# Advanced: Override voice per message
bash ~/.claude/hooks/play-tts.sh "Welcome message" "en_US-amy-medium"
bash ~/.claude/hooks/play-tts.sh "Bonjour!" "fr_FR-siwis-medium"
bash ~/.claude/hooks/play-tts.sh "British greeting" "en_GB-alan-medium"
```

**Parameters:**
- `$1` - **TEXT** (required): Message to speak
- `$2` - **VOICE** (optional): Voice name to override default

#### Audio Effects Configuration for OpenClaw

**File**: `.claude/config/audio-effects.cfg`

Customize audio effects, background music, and voice processing per agent or use default settings:

**Format:**
```
AGENT_NAME|SOX_EFFECTS|BACKGROUND_FILE|BACKGROUND_VOLUME
```

**Example Configuration:**

```bash
# Default - subtle background music
default||agentvibes_soft_flamenco_loop.mp3|0.30

# Custom agent with reverb + background
MyAgent|reverb 40 50 90 gain -2|agentvibes_soft_flamenco_loop.mp3|0.20

# Agent with pitch shift and EQ
Assistant|pitch -100 equalizer 3000 1q +2|agentvibes_dark_chill_step_loop.mp3|0.15
```

**Available SOX Effects:**

| Effect | Syntax | Example | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Reverb** | `reverb <reverberance> <HF-damping> <room-scale>` | `reverb 40 50 90` | Adds room ambiance (light: 30 40 70, heavy: 50 60 100) |
| **Pitch** | `pitch <cents>` | `pitch -100` | Shift pitch (100 cents = 1 semitone, negative = lower) |
| **Equalizer** | `equalizer <freq> <width>q <gain-dB>` | `equalizer 3000 1q +2` | Boost/cut frequencies (bass: 200Hz, treble: 4000Hz) |
| **Gain** | `gain <dB>` | `gain -2` | Adjust volume (negative = quieter, positive = louder) |
| **Compand** | `compand <attack,decay> <threshold:in,out>` | `compand 0.3,1 6:-70,-60,-20` | Dynamic range compression (makes quiet parts louder) |

**Background Music Tracks:**

Built-in tracks available in `.claude/audio/tracks/`:
- `agentvibes_soft_flamenco_loop.mp3` - Warm, rhythmic flamenco
- `agentvibes_dark_chill_step_loop.mp3` - Modern chill electronic
- (50+ additional tracks available)

**Background Volume:**
- `0.10` - Very subtle (10%)
- `0.20` - Subtle (20%)
- `0.30` - Moderate (30%, recommended default)
- `0.40` - Noticeable (40%, party mode)

**Example: OpenClaw Custom Configuration**

Create `.claude/config/audio-effects.cfg` on your OpenClaw server:

```bash
# OpenClaw assistant - warm voice with subtle reverb
OpenClaw|reverb 30 40 70 gain -1|agentvibes_soft_flamenco_loop.mp3|0.25

# Help desk agent - clear, bright voice
HelpDesk|equalizer 4000 1q +3 compand 0.2,0.5 6:-70,-60,-20|agentvibes_dark_chill_step_loop.mp3|0.15

# Default fallback
default||agentvibes_soft_flamenco_loop.mp3|0.30
```

**How AgentVibes Applies Effects:**

1. **Generate TTS** - Create base audio with Piper TTS
2. **Apply SOX effects** - Process audio (reverb, EQ, pitch, etc.)
3. **Mix background** - Blend background music at specified volume
4. **Tunnel via SSH** - Send processed audio to local receiver
5. **Play on device** - Output to phone/laptop speakers

This allows **per-message customization** or **consistent agent branding** with unique audio signatures!

### 🔊 Remote SSH Audio

Perfect for running OpenClaw on a remote server with audio on your local machine:

**Quick Setup:**

1. **Remote server** - Configure PulseAudio:
```bash
echo 'export PULSE_SERVER=tcp:localhost:14713' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

2. **Local machine** - Add SSH tunnel (`~/.ssh/config`):
```
Host your-server
    RemoteForward 14713 localhost:14713
```

3. **Connect and test**:
```bash
ssh your-server
agentvibes speak "Testing remote audio from OpenClaw"
```

- 🪟 WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

Users message you via WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord but only get text responses:
- ❌ No voice = Less engaging experience
- ❌ No personality = Feels robotic
- ❌ No audio cues = Miss important context

**AgentVibes Receiver transforms this:**
- ✅ OpenClaw speaks with voice (Siri-like experience)
- ✅ Audio streams to your device automatically
- ✅ You hear responses on your speakers
- ✅ Users get a conversational AI experience

### 🔧 How It Works

**One-time setup:**
1. Install AgentVibes on your voiceless server with OpenClaw
2. Install AgentVibes Receiver on your personal device (phone/tablet/laptop)

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Installation & Setup

**Q: Does AgentVibes require git-lfs?**
**A:** **NO.** AgentVibes has zero git-lfs requirement. Use `npx agentvibes install` - no git operations needed.

**Q: Do I need to clone the GitHub repository?**
**A:** **NO** (unless you're contributing code). Normal users should use `npx agentvibes install`. Repository cloning is only for developers who want to contribute to the project.

**Q: Why is the GitHub repo so large?**
**A:** The repo includes demo files and development dependencies (node_modules). The actual npm package you download is **< 50MB** and optimized for users.

**Q: What's the difference between npm install and git clone?**
**A:**
- `npx agentvibes install` → **For users** - Downloads pre-built package, zero git operations, instant setup
- `git clone ...` → **For developers only** - Full source code, development setup, contributing code

**Q: I saw an error about git-lfs, is something wrong?**
**A:** You're likely:
1. Using wrong installation method (use `npx` not `git clone`)
2. In a different project directory that uses git-lfs
3. Have global git config with lfs enabled

AgentVibes itself does NOT use or require git-lfs.

### Features & Usage

**Q: Does MCP consume tokens from my context window?**
**A:** **YES.** Every MCP tool schema adds to the context window. AgentVibes MCP is designed to be minimal (~1500-2000 tokens), but if you're concerned about token usage, you can use slash commands instead of MCP.

**Q: What's the difference between using MCP vs slash commands?**
**A:**
- **MCP**: Natural language ("Switch to Aria voice"), uses ~1500-2000 context tokens
- **Slash commands**: Explicit commands (`/agent-vibes:switch Aria`), zero token overhead

Both do the exact same thing - MCP is more convenient, slash commands are more token-efficient.

**Q: Is AgentVibes just a bash script?**
**A:** No. AgentVibes includes:
- Multi-provider TTS abstraction (Piper TTS, macOS Say)
- Voice management system with 50+ voices
- Personality & sentiment system
- Language learning mode with bilingual playback
- Audio effects processing (reverb, EQ, compression)
- MCP server for natural language control
- BMAD integration for multi-agent voice switching
- Remote audio optimization for SSH/RDP sessions

**Q: Can I use AgentVibes without BMAD?**
**A:** **YES.** AgentVibes works standalone. BMAD integration is optional - only activates if you install BMAD separately.

**Q: What are the audio dependencies?**
**A:**
- **Required**: Node.js 16+, Python 3.10+ (for Piper TTS)
- **Optional**: sox (audio effects), ffmpeg (background music, padding)
- All TTS generation works without optional dependencies - they just enhance the experience

### Troubleshooting

**Q: Why isn't Claude speaking?**
**A:** Common causes:
1. Hook not installed - Run `npx agentvibes install --yes`
2. Audio player missing - Install `sox` and `ffmpeg`
3. TTS protocol not enabled in settings
4. Test with `/agent-vibes:sample Aria`

**Q: Can I use this on Windows?**
**A:** Yes! AgentVibes supports **native Windows** with PowerShell scripts (Soprano, Piper, SAPI providers). See [Windows Native Setup](WINDOWS-SETUP.md). WSL is also supported for legacy workflows - see [Windows WSL Guide](mcp-server/WINDOWS_SETUP.md).

**Q: How do I reduce token usage?**
**A:**
1. Use slash commands instead of MCP (zero context token overhead)
2. Set verbosity to LOW (`/agent-vibes:verbosity low`)
3. Disable BMAD integration if not using it
