## 🎙️ AgentVibes MCP (Easiest Way to Use AgentVibes!)

**🎯 The easiest way to control AgentVibes - just talk naturally!**

In addition to installing AgentVibes in Claude Code using the NPX installer, we **highly recommend** installing the AgentVibes MCP server. This allows you to control AgentVibes simply by talking naturally to it (especially if you've installed [WhisperTyping](https://whispertyping.com/)), rather than having to remember slash commands.

**Note:** Slash commands (`/agent-vibes:*`) only work in Claude Code. For Claude Desktop and Warp Terminal, you **must** use the AgentVibes MCP for voice control.

Instead of remembering slash commands like `/agent-vibes:switch Aria`, just say:
- "Switch to Aria voice"
- "Change to pirate personality"
- "Speak in Spanish"
- "List available voices"

### Why Use AgentVibes MCP?

✅ **Natural language** - No commands to memorize

✅ **Works everywhere** - Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Warp Terminal

✅ **Unified interface** - Same tools across all apps

✅ **Smart context** - Project-specific or global settings

### Quick MCP Setup

#### For Claude Desktop

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Claude Desktop on Windows requires WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) enabled. The MCP server will also automatically install Python dependencies (Python MCP package, pipx, Piper TTS) on first run.

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentvibes": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "agentvibes-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "ELEVENLABS_API_KEY": "${ELEVENLABS_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Warp Terminal

Add to `~/.warp/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "agentvibes": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "agentvibes-mcp-server"],
    "env": {
      "ELEVENLABS_API_KEY": "${ELEVENLABS_API_KEY}"
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Claude Code

Add to `.mcp-minimal.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentvibes": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "agentvibes-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "ELEVENLABS_API_KEY": "${ELEVENLABS_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**That's it!** Restart the app and start using natural language:

```
"Switch to Northern Terry voice"
"Change personality to sarcastic"
"What voices are available?"
"Speak in French"
"Show my current configuration"
```

### AgentVibes MCP vs Slash Commands

| Feature | AgentVibes MCP | Slash Commands |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Ease of Use** | Natural language | Must remember syntax |
| **Works In** | Claude Desktop, Warp, Claude Code | Claude Code only |
| **Setup** | Add to config file | Auto-installed |
| **Examples** | "Switch voice to Aria" | `/agent-vibes:switch Aria` |

**💡 Recommendation:** Use **AgentVibes MCP for daily use** (easier), **slash commands for scripting** (precise).

### Available AgentVibes MCP Tools

All these work with natural language:

| Tool | Example Command |
|------|-----------------|
| **text_to_speech** | "Say hello in a pirate voice" |
| **list_voices** | "What voices are available?" |
| **set_voice** | "Change to Aria voice" |
| **list_personalities** | "Show me all personalities" |
| **set_personality** | "Set personality to flirty" |
| **set_language** | "Speak in Spanish" |
| **get_config** | "What's my current voice?" |
| **replay_audio** | "Replay the last message" |

### Where Settings Are Saved

The MCP server is smart about where it saves settings:

- **Warp Terminal** → Global `~/.claude/` (terminal-wide settings)
- **Claude Code** → Project `.claude/` (per-project settings)
- **Claude Desktop** → Project `.claude/` (per-project settings)

This means different projects can have different voices/personalities!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Install AgentVibes

Choose your preferred installation method:

#### **Option A: Using npx (Recommended)** ⚡
No installation needed! Run directly:
```bash
npx agentvibes install
```

#### **Option B: Install globally via npm** 📦
Install once, use anywhere:
```bash
npm install -g agentvibes
agentvibes install
```

#### **Option C: From source (Development)** 🔧
Clone and run from repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulpreibisch/AgentVibes.git
cd AgentVibes
npm install
node bin/agent-vibes install
```

### Step 2: Choose Your TTS Provider

AgentVibes supports two TTS providers - pick the one that fits your needs:

#### **Option A: Piper TTS (Free, Recommended for Getting Started)** 🆓

**No setup required!** Piper TTS works out of the box with zero configuration.

- ✅ Completely free, no API key needed
- ✅ Works offline (perfect for Windows, WSL, Linux)
- ✅ 50+ neural voices
- ✅ 18 languages supported
- ✅ Privacy-focused local processing

**To use:** Just install AgentVibes and you're done! The installer will set Piper as default if no ElevenLabs key is detected.

#### **Option B: ElevenLabs (Premium AI Voices)** 🎤

**Best for production and variety.** Requires API key but offers 150+ premium voices.

- ✅ 150+ professional AI voices
- ✅ 30+ languages with multilingual v2
- ✅ Studio-quality audio with emotional range
- ✅ Character voices and unique personalities

**Setup steps:**

1. Sign up at [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io/) (free tier: 10,000 chars/month)
2. Copy your API key from the dashboard
3. Add it to your environment:

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
echo 'export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Switch providers anytime:** `/agent-vibes:provider switch`

### Step 3: Enable Voice ⚠️ **CRITICAL STEP**

#### For Claude Code:
**🔴 REQUIRED:** You MUST run this command to enable TTS in Claude Code:
```bash
/output-style agent-vibes
```

#### For Claude Desktop/Warp:
**Already works!** AgentVibes MCP is enabled by default once configured.

**That's it! Claude will now speak to you!** 🎉

## 🎭 Personalities vs Sentiments

### 🎪 Personalities (Voice + Style)

**Personalities change BOTH voice AND how Claude talks.** Each has a dedicated ElevenLabs voice:

| Personality | Voice | Style |
|------------|-------|-------|
| **sarcastic** | Jessica Anne Bogart | Dry wit and cutting observations |
| **flirty** | Jessica Anne Bogart | Playful charm and compliments |
| **pirate** | Pirate Marshal | Seafaring swagger - "Arr matey!" |
| **grandpa** | Grandpa Spuds Oxley | Rambling nostalgic stories |
| **dry-humor** | Aria | British wit and deadpan delivery |
| **angry** | Demon Monster | Frustrated and loud |
| **robot** | Dr. Von Fusion | Mechanical and precise |
| **zen** | Aria | Peaceful and mindful |
| **professional** | Matthew Schmitz | Formal and corporate |

**All 19 personalities:** sarcastic, flirty, pirate, grandpa, dry-humor, angry, robot, zen, professional, dramatic, millennial, surfer-dude, sassy, poetic, moody, funny, annoying, crass, normal, random

```bash
/agent-vibes:personality sarcastic
/agent-vibes:personality pirate
/agent-vibes:personality list
```

### 💭 Sentiments (Style Only)

**Sentiments apply personality styles to YOUR current voice:**

```bash
# Use YOUR voice with sarcastic attitude
/agent-vibes:sentiment sarcastic

# Clear sentiment
/agent-vibes:sentiment clear
```

**Key Difference:**
- **Personality** = Changes voice + style (e.g., Pirate Marshal + pirate speak)
- **Sentiment** = Keeps your voice + adds style (e.g., Your Voice + sarcasm)

### 🎤 Combine Voice + Sentiment

```bash
# Switch to Aria with sarcastic sentiment
/agent-vibes:switch Aria --sentiment sarcastic
```

```

### MCP Not Working?

1. **Check config file**: Verify JSON syntax in `claude_desktop_config.json` or `.mcp-minimal.json`
2. **Restart app**: Close and reopen Claude Desktop/Warp/Claude Code
3. **Check logs**: Look for MCP connection errors in app logs
4. **Verify npx**: Run `npx -y agentvibes-mcp-server` manually to test

## 🔌 BMAD Plugin (Full Documentation)

**Automatically switch voices when using BMAD agents!**

The BMAD plugin detects when you activate a BMAD agent (e.g., `/BMad:agents:pm`) and automatically uses the assigned voice for that role.

### Default BMAD Voice Mappings

| Agent | Role | Voice | Personality |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|
| **pm** | Product Manager | Jessica Anne Bogart | professional |
| **dev** | Developer | Matthew Schmitz | normal |
| **qa** | QA Engineer | Burt Reynolds | professional |
| **architect** | Architect | Michael | normal |
| **po** | Product Owner | Tiffany | professional |
| **analyst** | Analyst | Ralf Eisend | normal |
| **sm** | Scrum Master | Ms. Walker | professional |
| **ux-expert** | UX Expert | Aria | normal |
| **bmad-master** | BMAD Master | Archer | zen |
| **bmad-orchestrator** | Orchestrator | Tom | professional |

### Plugin Management

```bash
# Check status (auto-enables if BMAD detected)
/agent-vibes-bmad status

# Disable plugin
/agent-vibes-bmad disable

# Re-enable plugin
/agent-vibes-bmad enable

# Customize agent voice
/agent-vibes-bmad set pm "Aria" zen

# Edit configuration
/agent-vibes-bmad edit
```

### How It Works

1. **Auto-Detection**: Plugin checks for `.bmad-core/install-manifest.yaml`
2. **Auto-Enable**: Enables automatically when BMAD is detected
3. **Settings Preservation**: Saves your previous voice/personality when enabling
4. **Restore on Disable**: Restores previous settings when disabling

### 🌍 Language Support with BMAD

When you set a language, AgentVibes intelligently selects the best voice:

**Language Priority System:**
1. **BMAD Agent Active** + **Language Set**: Uses multilingual version of agent's assigned voice
   - If agent's voice doesn't support the language → switches to Antoni/Rachel/Domi/Bella (multilingual)
2. **BMAD Agent Active** + **No Language Set**: Uses agent's assigned voice (default English)
3. **No BMAD Agent** + **Language Set**: Uses current voice if multilingual, otherwise switches to Antoni
4. **No BMAD Agent** + **No Language Set**: Uses current voice/personality normally

**Example Workflow:**
```bash
# Set language to Spanish
/agent-vibes:set-language spanish

# Activate BMAD PM agent
/BMad:agents:pm
# → Will try to use Jessica Anne Bogart for Spanish
# → If not multilingual, falls back to Antoni (Spanish-optimized)

# All TTS will speak in Spanish with appropriate voice
```

**Supported Languages:**
- Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Dutch, Turkish, Russian, and 20+ more

**Multilingual Fallback Voices:**
- **Antoni** - Best for Spanish
- **Rachel** - Best for French
- **Domi** - Best for German
- **Bella** - Best for Italian
- **Charlotte** - European languages
- **Matilda** - Latin languages

```

### Voice Settings Storage

**Project-Local Settings** (`.claude/` in project):
- **Current Provider**: `tts-provider.txt` - Active TTS provider (elevenlabs/piper)
- **Current Voice**: `tts-voice.txt` - Selected voice name
- **Current Personality**: `tts-personality.txt` - Active personality
- **Current Sentiment**: `tts-sentiment.txt` - Active sentiment
- **Current Language**: `tts-language.txt` - Selected language

**Global Fallback** (`~/.claude/`):
Settings fall back to global config if project-local doesn't exist.

**How it works:**
1. AgentVibes checks `.claude/` in current project first
2. Falls back to `~/.claude/` if project setting doesn't exist
3. This allows different voices/personalities per project!

Settings persist across Claude Code sessions!
