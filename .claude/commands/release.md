# /release

Semi-automated release process with AI-generated release notes and human approval checkpoints.

This command:
1. **Runs full test suite** - MUST pass before proceeding ✅
2. **Validates Sonar quality gates** - MUST pass before proceeding ✅
3. Analyzes all changes since the last release (git log + diffs)
4. Reads actual code changes to understand context
5. **Generates AI summary and release notes**
6. **PAUSES for human review of RELEASE_NOTES.md** ⏸️
7. **PAUSES for human review of AI summary** ⏸️
8. Updates installer.js and update scripts with AI summary
9. **Updates README.md with new version and release info** ⚠️
10. Bumps the version using npm version
11. Commits everything together (including updated README)
12. Pushes to master with --follow-tags
13. Creates GitHub release
14. **Publishes to npm** (packages README at this moment!)

**⚠️ CRITICAL ORDER**: README must be updated (step 8) BEFORE npm publish (step 13) because npm packages whatever README exists at publish time. This ensures the npm package page displays current release info.

**🧪 TEST REQUIREMENT**: The test suite MUST pass before any release operations begin. If tests fail, the release is aborted immediately. This prevents publishing broken code to npm.

**🛡️ SONAR QUALITY GATES**: All SonarCloud quality requirements from CLAUDE.md MUST be validated before release:

### Shell Script Security (Bash)
- ✅ All bash scripts MUST have `set -euo pipefail` at the top (strict mode)
- ✅ All variables MUST be quoted (e.g., `"$VARIABLE"`, not `$VARIABLE`)
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- ✅ Input validation for all external inputs
- ✅ Secure temp directories (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` with fallback)
- ✅ Path traversal prevention
- ✅ File ownership verification before processing
- ✅ Single quotes in trap statements (deferred expansion)

### JavaScript/Node.js Security
- ✅ Use `path.resolve()` for path operations
- ✅ Path safety validation (prevent traversal)
- ✅ No sensitive data in logs (mask credentials)
- ✅ Try-finally for resource cleanup

### General Code Quality
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Proper resource cleanup
- ✅ Meaningful variable names
- ✅ Security-critical code is commented

**If ANY quality gate fails, the release MUST be aborted** until issues are fixed.

## Usage

```bash
# Patch release (bug fixes) - default
/release
/release patch

# Minor release (new features)
/release minor

# Major release (breaking changes)
/release major
```

## Human-in-the-Loop Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Review RELEASE_NOTES.md
After AI generates release notes, **you will be asked to review**:
- AI-generated summary
- Categorized changes (features, fixes, docs, tests)
- User impact notes
- Breaking changes (if any)

**You can**:
- ✅ Approve as-is
- ✏️ Edit before proceeding
- ❌ Cancel release

### Checkpoint 2: Review AI Summary
The AI summary will be shown to you for approval before being added to:
- `src/installer.js` (shown during `npx agentvibes install`)
- Update scripts (shown during `npx agentvibes update`)

**You can**:
- ✅ Approve summary
- ✏️ Request changes
- ❌ Cancel release

## What Gets Updated

### RELEASE_NOTES.md
Complete release history with:
- AI-generated summary
- Categorized changes
- User impact
- Migration notes (if breaking changes)

### src/installer.js
**CRITICAL**: Update the `showReleaseInfo()` function (around line 126) with:
- New version number in the title
- New "WHAT'S NEW" summary (2-4 sentences about the release)
- New "KEY HIGHLIGHTS" bullet points (3-5 items with emojis)

Example structure:
```javascript
function showReleaseInfo() {
  console.log(
    boxen(
      chalk.white.bold('═══...═══\n') +
      chalk.cyan.bold('  📦 AgentVibes v2.7.0 - Release Title Here\n') +
      chalk.white.bold('═══...═══\n\n') +
      chalk.green.bold('🎙️ WHAT\'S NEW:\n\n') +
      chalk.cyan('AgentVibes v2.7.0 summary here...\n\n') +
      chalk.green.bold('✨ KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n') +
      chalk.gray('   🎭 Feature 1 - Description\n') +
      chalk.gray('   ⏸️ Feature 2 - Description\n') +
      // ... more highlights
```

This appears during `npx agentvibes install` and `npx agentvibes update`.

## What Happens

1. **Test Suite**: Runs `npm test` - MUST pass or release is aborted 🧪
2. **Sonar Quality Gates**: Validates all security and quality requirements - MUST pass or release is aborted 🛡️
3. **Git Analysis**: Reviews all commits since last tag
4. **Code Review**: Examines actual diffs for context
5. **AI Generation**: Creates intelligent summary and categorized changes
6. **Human Review**: You review and approve/edit release notes
7. **Summary Review**: You approve AI summary for installer/update
8. **Installer Update**: Adds release info to installation flow
9. **README Update**: Updates version badge and latest release section ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Must happen BEFORE npm publish!**
10. **Update Script Update**: Adds release info to update flow
11. **Version Bump**: Updates package.json (npm version)
12. **Commit**: Single atomic commit with all changes (includes README with correct version)
13. **Push**: Pushes to **master** branch with tags
14. **GitHub Release**: Creates public release with notes
15. **NPM Publish**: Makes new version available globally (packages README at this point)

**⚠️ ORDER IS CRITICAL**: README must be updated BEFORE running `npm publish` because npm packages the README from the current working directory. If you publish first, the npm package page will show outdated README content.

## Safety Features

- **Test suite must pass** before proceeding - prevents broken releases
- **Sonar quality gates must pass** - prevents security issues and poor code quality
- **Human approval required** before any git operations
- **Dry-run preview** of all changes

- `README.md` - Version badge and latest release section
- `package.json` - Version bump
- `package-lock.json` - Version bump
- `src/installer.js` - Release info display
- Git tag created (e.g., `v2.1.0`)

## Implementation

This command tells Claude AI to prepare and push a new release with AI-generated notes and human approval checkpoints.

### Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

When executing this command, Claude MUST follow these steps in order:

1. **Run Test Suite** (MANDATORY FIRST STEP):
   - Execute `npm test` (which runs syntax validation, BATS tests, and coverage tests)
   - If ANY tests fail, STOP immediately and report the failures
   - Do NOT proceed with any release operations if tests fail
   - Example output: "🧪 Running tests... ✅ All 213 BATS tests passed, ✅ All 38 Node tests passed"

2. **Validate Sonar Quality Gates** (MANDATORY SECOND STEP):
   - Check all bash scripts for `set -euo pipefail` (strict mode)
   - Verify no hardcoded credentials in code
   - Validate proper variable quoting in bash scripts
   - Check for input validation and error handling
   - Review any new or modified files for security issues
   - If ANY quality gate fails, STOP immediately and report the issues
   - Example output: "🛡️ Validating quality gates... ✅ All Sonar requirements met"
   - **Note**: Document any known minor issues (like missing strict mode in legacy scripts) if they existed before this release

3. **Analyze Changes**: Git log since last tag, examine diffs
4. **Generate RELEASE_NOTES.md**: AI-generated summary with categorized changes
5. **Human Review Checkpoint 1**: Wait for approval of RELEASE_NOTES.md
6. **Update src/installer.js**:
   - Find the `showReleaseInfo()` function (line ~126)
   - Replace the version number in title (e.g., `v2.6.0` → `v2.7.0`)
   - Replace the release title (e.g., `BMAD Integration` → `Party Mode Voice Improvements`)
   - Replace the "WHAT'S NEW" summary (2-4 sentences from RELEASE_NOTES.md AI Summary)
   - Replace all "KEY HIGHLIGHTS" bullets (extract from RELEASE_NOTES.md)
   - Keep the same format/structure, just update content
7. **Update README.md** ⚠️ **CRITICAL - Must complete BEFORE npm publish**:
   - **Version badge is auto-updated** by the `version` npm lifecycle hook via `scripts/sync-readme-version.js` — do NOT manually edit it
   - Update "Latest Release" section (line ~112+):
     - Replace the title and URL: `**[vX.X.X - Release Title](github.com/...)**`
     - Replace the AI summary paragraph (first paragraph after title)
     - Replace all "Key Highlights" bullet points (extract from RELEASE_NOTES.md)
   - This ensures GitHub README and npm package page show correct version
8. **Human Review Checkpoint 2**: Show what will be updated, wait for approval
9. **Bump package.json**: Use npm version (patch/minor/major)
10. **Commit all changes**: Single commit with RELEASE_NOTES.md, installer.js, README.md, package.json
11. **Push to master with tags**
12. **Create GitHub release**
13. **Publish to npm**: This packages the already-updated README.md

### Critical Points

- **ALWAYS run tests first** - Never proceed with release if tests fail
- **ALWAYS validate Sonar quality gates** - Never proceed with release if quality checks fail
- **NEVER skip updating installer.js** - This is what users see during install
- **Update installer BEFORE npm publish** - npm packages whatever installer.js exists at publish time
- **Extract content from RELEASE_NOTES.md** - Don't make up new content, use what's in the release notes
- **Keep the installer format consistent** - Same boxen structure, just update text content
- **Document any security exceptions** - If known issues exist from before this release, document them
